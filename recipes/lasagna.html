        <p>Lasagna is basically a high-performance, multi-layered pasta operation. You’ve got flat sheets acting like structural blueprints, stacked with tomato sauce, meat or veggies, and creamy ricotta or béchamel acting as operational glue. When everything aligns, it becomes a fully integrated flavor system instead of random ingredients freelancing for attention.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throw that stack into the oven, run the “bake until golden” deployment cycle, and what comes out is a dense, morale-boosting asset. It’s structured, comforting, and engineered to hit every taste KPI without compromise.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>Lasagna pasta sheets</ul>
        <ul>Ground beef (or chicken/veg alternative)</ul>
        <ul>Onion, garlic</ul>
        <ul>Tomato sauce / crushed tomatoes</ul>
        <ul>Salt, pepper, chili flakes</ul>
        <ul>Italian seasoning (basil, oregano, thyme)</ul>
        <ul>Ricotta cheese or béchamel sauce (butter, flour, milk)</ul>
        <ul>Mozzarella cheese (grated)</ul>
        <ul>Parmesan cheese (optional but highly ROI-positive)</ul>

        <h2>Steps to make lasagna</h2>
        <li><strong>Prep the sauces</strong></li>
        <p>Sauté onions and garlic, add ground meat, cook it through, then pour in tomato sauce and season it. Separately, mix ricotta (or make béchamel: butter + flour + milk) so you have your creamy layer ready.</p>
        <li><strong>Build the stack</strong></li>
        <p>In a baking dish, layer in this order: sauce → pasta sheets → ricotta/béchamel → mozzarella. Repeat the cycle like a disciplined sprint loop until you run out. Finish with a heavy mozzarella top layer.</p>
        <li><strong>Bake</strong></li>
        <p>Cover with foil, bake at 180–200°C for ~25 minutes, then uncover and let the cheese turn golden for another 10–15. Rest for 10 minutes so the structure doesn’t collapse like a poorly managed project.</p>
